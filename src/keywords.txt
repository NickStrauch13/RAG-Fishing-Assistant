Create chunks by combining 8 paragraphs.

New chunks should be made up of same month if possible.

Set all to lowercase

Go down list, find 8 paragraphs with first keyword and "January". Once done (or if not enough in jan, sppend feb on), move onto "Feburary" with the same keyword. Go through all 12 months for a single keyword. Then move onto next keyword and start from jan. If you get all the way through the months without filling up a chunk, itll be a short chunk. 

So assuming a popular keyword, there should be 12 new chunks for it made up of 86 paragraphs after a single year pass, each new chunk representing a different month.
